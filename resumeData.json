Not only is he a great team player but also is a quick learner. During his time at Credit Suisse, he learned an entirely new tech stack in a couple of weeks and afterwards went on to become the go-to person for almost everything related to our project. It's been awesome working with him and watch him jump into every project with curiosity, gratitude, and an infectiously upbeat attitude.",
